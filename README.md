Prometheus
=========
A simple plymouth replacement by using egl and drm.

drm demos
=========
these demos are immature and may harm your video card, try with caution.

* drm_tty demos how to setup kms buffer to render on.
* egl_drm_tty2 demos opengl rendered on egl surface.
* egl_drm_tty3 demos animated opengl on egl surface.
* egl_drm_shining_circle animated circling with bad frame rate (problemmatic driver maybe)
